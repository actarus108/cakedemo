Make an assessment of Cake 

## What is cake ? 

Cake (C# Make) is a free and open source cross-platform build automation system with a C# DSL for tasks such as compiling code, copying files and folders, running unit tests, compressing files and building NuGet packages.

### Familiar

Cake is built on top of the Roslyn compiler which enables you to write your build scripts in pure C# in either a standard console project, using Cake Frosting, or as Cake script using Cake .NET Tool.

### Cross platform & cross runtime

Cake runs on modern .NET platform (.NET Core 3.1 or .NET 5 and newer) and is available on Windows, Linux and macOS. 

### IDE integration

Cake can run as simple console applications with full IDE integration including IntelliSense or refactoring. There are extensions available to provide advanced features for most popular IDEs and editors. 

### Reliable

Regardless if you're building on your own machine, or building on a CI system such as Azure Pipelines, GitHub Actions, TeamCity or Jenkins, Cake is built to behave in the same way. See Build Systems for a full list.

### Batteries included

Cake supports the most common tools used during builds such as MSBuild, .NET Core CLI, MSTest, xUnit, NUnit, NuGet, ILMerge, WiX and SignTool out of the box and many more through an ever growing list of addins and modules.

### Open source & community backed

Cake will always be free and open source, even for commercial use. If you want to support us we accept donations. There's an amazing community around Cake with several hundred contributors which are involved in the project and we would love to have you on board too.
